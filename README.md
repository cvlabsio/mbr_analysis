# Analysis of an MBR payload

In recent years, we've seen interesting MBR payloads, ranging from [ransomware](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/) to generic malware.  
While new technologies ([UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI)) makes MBR payloads obsolete, the sad reality is that old BIOS-style boot sequences are still commonly used.  
This blogpost reverse engineers MBR payloads - I really like old real mode Assembly, so the MBR payloads are a nice opportunity. Let's go!

## What is an MBR
In the old days before UEFI, the first code to run was the [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS), which is a piece of software (firmware).
The BIOS had several responsibilities, most notable [Power-On-Self-Test (POST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test), which verifies the CPU registers, BIOS integrity, RAM, DMA, timers etc.
